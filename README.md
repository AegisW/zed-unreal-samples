# ZED Unreal Samples
This repository contains Unreal sample projects that demonstrate the Mixed reality features offered by the [ZED Unreal Plugin](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-unreal-plugin).

The `ZED Unreal Plugin` is already integrated in the samples, the only requirement is to install the dedicated [Unreal Engine version](https://github.com/stereolabs/UnrealEngine).
Instructions can be found in the dedicated [documentation](https://www.stereolabs.com/documentation/mixed-reality/unreal/getting-started.html) and in the modified [Unreal Engine](https://github.com/stereolabs/UnrealEngine) repository.

To use the samples, open the `ZEDSamples.uproject` file.
